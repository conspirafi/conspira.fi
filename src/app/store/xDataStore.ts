    text: "Comet 3I/Atlas is doing things Science has never seen before and comes from the direction of famous 1977 Deep Space “Wow!” signal...🧐🤔 This object came into our system from the direction of the Sagittarius constellation. This is the same direction from which we got the famous, narrow band 'Wow!' signal, taking place in 1977 at Ohio State University’s 'Big Ear' radio telescope. Also, this object is traveling almost perfectly within the plane of our solar system. How is this even possible for an interstellar visitor from outside of our solar system?Alien enthusiasts are having a field day with this one. I, for one, am hoping that NASA will utilize the Juno spacecraft that’s still circling Jupiter to take up-close pictures of this thing, whatever it is.",

    text: "🚨 3I/ATLAS: The Colossus from Interstellar Space Dr. Avi Loeb confirms new data shows this object is at least 33 billion tons, over 100,000 times more massive than Oumuamua. Its minimum size is 5 km across, possibly up to 46 km, bigger than Manhattan. It glows green, shedding nickel with no iron (seen only in industrial alloys). It is perfectly aligned with the planetary plane, odds of that by chance are 1 in 500. It has an anti-tail glow toward the Sun instead of away, and is moving at 60 km/s (600× faster than a NASCAR). On Oct 3, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will image it with 30 km resolution per pixel, our first real look at the object. Harvard’s Avi Loeb now puts 3I/ATLAS at Level 4 on the Loeb Scale (0 = natural rock, 10 = hostile tech). This is only the third interstellar object ever detected, and it’s the strangest by far. If it’s artificial, history changes overnight. Eyes on October!",

    text: "Oddities about 3I/ATLAS - our current extra-solar (outside the solar system) visitor: 1. The presence of nickel: the detection of nickel (specifically atomic nickel vapor, denoted as Ni I emission lines). Nickel is a heavy metal with a high sublimation temperature—around 1,500–2,000 K for pure nickel under vacuum conditions—far hotter than the ambient temperatures at 3–4 AU (where equilibrium blackbody temperatures are only ~140–170 K). For nickel to appear as atomic gas in the coma at these distances, it can't be from simple thermal sublimation of typical metal or sulfide phases (like those in meteorites)....",

    text: "🚨 3I/ATLAS is anomalously massive 🚨 Fresh data suggests it weighs at least 33 billion tons with a nucleus over 5 km wide. To put that in perspective: Earth’s Moon: ~7.35 × 10¹⁹ tons, ~3,474 km across 3I/ATLAS: ≥33 × 10⁹ tons, >5 km across That makes 3I/ATLAS about 2 trillion times less massive than the Moon, and roughly 700 times smaller in diameter. It is enormous for an interstellar visitor, yet still tiny compared to planetary bodies. Here’s why this matters: Over 4,000 observations from 227 observatories show no detectable non-gravitational acceleration. Even while venting CO₂ and H₂O, it isn’t being nudged off course — meaning it’s incredibly massive. Loeb, Cloete & Veres’ analysis confirms: ≥33 billion tons minimum mass.....",

    text: "1 of 2: Well done article on the Loeb theorization of the WOW signal emanating from 3I/Atlas. The original signal did emanate from the same general direction  as 3I/Atlas, Sagittarius, near the star Tau Sagittarii, however, 600AU seems an absurd distance for the signal to have traveled from this object to Earth, back in 1977, given that it would require harnessing power from an entire planet or star.",
